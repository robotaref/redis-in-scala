This is a starting point for Scala solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).
# Running the program

1. Ensure you have `sbt (1.9.9)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `src/main/scala/codecrafters_redis/Server.scala`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
